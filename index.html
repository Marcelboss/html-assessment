                <p> With experience I have obtain from style.css, i can effectively manipulate various design elements
                    such as colours, typography, layout, and spacing to create a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing
                    website.Overall, having experience in style.css is an essential skill for any web developer or
                    designer as it enables you to create beautiful and functional websites that effectively communicate
                    the intended
                    message to the target audience.
